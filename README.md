# Scraping Websites with R
21 October 2024

A workshop covering the process of using the (rvest library)[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/index.html] to collect data from the Internet.

## Getting ready
You'll need to install the [SelectorGadget](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb?hl=en) extension for the Chrome browser in addition to making sure you're able to access the University's [Noteable service](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/launch). 

On the day of the workshop, bring your laptop and charger!

## Overview
This intermediate workshop will teach you how to scrape data from the Internet using R. We will start with a theoretical introduction to web scraping and specific approaches to scraping static websites with a focus on HTML tags. Then, we will practice using rvest to scrape data from a webpage. Finally, we will discuss methods for scraping information from webpages with a more complex structure.  

This is an intermediate-level course. Students must have a basic background in R. This includes understanding the basic data types in R; how to install and load packages; and how to use functions, pipes, and apply/map functions. Alternatively, the 'Introduction to Programming with R and RStudio' course counts as a prerequisite.
